# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project I have performed Natural Language Processing on Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset containing data for over 14000 tweets.
I have used several classifiers namely Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine in order to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.

This project was done as a part of Data Science and Machine Learning course offered by Coding Ninjas.
